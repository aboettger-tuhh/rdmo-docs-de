Installation
============

For demonstration, development or testing purposes, RDMO can be installed on Linux, Windows and macOS. If you, however, to set up a production enviroment, serving RDMO over a Network or the Internet, we strongly suggest that you use a recent Linux distribution, namely CentOS7, Debian 8 or 9, or Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus).

The code is mainly written in Python and should work with a Python higher than 3.4. RDMO works also on Python 2.7. Please note that for a CentOS7/Apache setup, only Python 2.7 is possible.

An installation of RDMO contains of three parts:

1) A directory which holds all the settings and customisations, custom to your installation of RDMO. We will call this directory ``rdmo-app``, but you can use any name you see fit.
2) The actual ``rdmo`` package, which centrally maintained by the RDMO team, and is installed as a dependency in a virtual environement.
3) A database to store the content generated by the users of your RDMO installation. Currently, we support Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite.

This chapter shows how these components are set up. Optional components can be installed afterwards and are covered under :doc:`Configuration </configuration/index>`.

For testing and development, you can run RDMO using your regular user account. On a production system, a dedicated user account should be used. We suggest to create a user called ``rdmo`` with the group ``rdmo`` and the home directory ``/srv/rdmo``. We will use this user throughout this documantation.

Do not use the ``root`` user to run RDMO! It is a bad idea anyway and several steps of the installation will not work. ``sudo`` is used in the installation when needing root-privileges to install packages.
